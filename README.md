###  **CO₂ Emission Prediction using Linear Regression**

**Description:**

This project focuses on predicting **CO₂ emissions** from vehicles using a **Linear Regression model** developed in a Jupyter Notebook. The dataset contains features such as **engine size, number of cylinders, and fuel consumption**, which are used to train the model to estimate the CO₂ emissions of cars.

**Key Features:**

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and relationships.
* Data visualization using libraries like **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.
* Preprocessing and normalization of data.
* Model training using **Scikit-learn's LinearRegression**.
* Evaluation using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² score**.
* Visualization of regression line and prediction results.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
